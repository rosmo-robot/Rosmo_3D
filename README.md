# Rosmo_3D

:warning: In development. 

See https://github.com/rosmo-robot/Rosmo_3D/blob/main/V4/servo/Readme.md

It is part of the [rosmo.io](https://rosmo.io) project. You can find complete BOM on the Rosmo website.

What is Rosmo?

It's a modular set of open-hardware components that can be assembled into robots of different complexity and price.

It's all based on ESP32 so should support MicroROS work.

There are a number of different needs for 'starter' robot kits.

Software that's interesting to us right now includes:

Linorobot2 C++/ Platformio / Ros2

Hadabot (Micropython ROS2, Docker)
